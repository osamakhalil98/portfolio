So i really see it now as a good investment to your time and your skills to anyone in general.\nUsually software engineers talk about how they were CRAZY about programming and how they always ADMIRED computers, terminal commands instead of GUIs, etc.. buuut unfortunately i wasn't that guy, i was just using computers like any other regular consumer, mostly

the way of doing it was mostly just following some tutorials to do X or Y, and let's just examine why this way of learning is NOT recommended or best practice for any newbie dev:\n<br/>\n1- As i've mentioned, not mastering the fundementals of programming will haunt you when you jump to any advanced technology or framework directly.\n<br/>\n2- Relying heavily on tutorials without practicing can be useless in alot of cases and time wasting, this is known as Tutorial Purgatory you can read about it more in this awesome article
